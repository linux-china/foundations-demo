Foundations demo
===================

Foundations is a modular Rust library, designed to help scale programs for distributed, production-grade systems. It enables engineers to concentrate on the core business logic of their services, rather than the intricacies of production operation setups.

If you need any of those:

* logging
* distributed tracing
* metrics
* memory profiling and jemalloc allocator
* security features, such as seccomp-based syscall sandboxing
* service configuration with documentation
* CLI helper that takes care of the configuration loading
